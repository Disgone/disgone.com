# Ciao!

I'm Shaun Smith.  You've stumbled across [disgone.com]({{< ref "/" >}}), or DiG, my personal space on the web.

In the light hours, I pose as a mild mannered software developer.  I do the same during the night too.  When I need a change of pace I enjoy woodworking and try to fit in a good video game. I'm currently based in the Dallas, Texas area.

I've managed multiple iterations of this domain for the last 15 years, with an evolving mission statement with the latest iteration being fairly simple.  Whenenver I have a hard time finding a solution to something and manage to scrape a solution together, I'll post it.  Additionally, I'll let my selfish side roam free and post things I find interesting.

Enjoy!
